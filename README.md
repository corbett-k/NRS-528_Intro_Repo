I'm a 2nd year M.S. student in the Biological and Environmental Sciences program, working with Drs. Peter Paton and Scott McWilliams. My thesis research focuses on coastal waterbirds in Rhode Island, specifically how to improve measuring their distribution and abundance using novel approaches with Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS), or drones.

Prior to arriving at URI in the Fall of 2020, I worked in the Everglades for six months on a long-term research project run by the University of Florida. In addition to performing the usual tasks of a field technician, I was also the project's drone pilot, collecting aerial imagery over tree island colonies of wading birds (sometimes in the thousands).
